# Student Score Prediction

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict student scores based on their study hours.
The model is trained on a dataset containing study hours and corresponding test scores, then evaluated using common regression metrics.

## Features

- Reads student data from a CSV file
- Trains a linear regression model
- Makes predictions
- Shows how good the model is (RÂ² score and RMSE)
- Draws a simple graph to compare actual vs predicted scores

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
